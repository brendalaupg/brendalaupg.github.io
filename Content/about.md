Hi there! I'm Brenda Lau, an iOS Software Engineer from Kuala Lumpur üá≤üáæ. I won the Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference Scholarship in 2018 and I graduated from Asia Pacific Univeristy with a Bachelors (Hons) in Information Technology. Currently, my learning interests are Machine Learning and Data Science. My mission in life is to help make people's lives better!

I created this site to log my learnings, showcase my projects, and write just about anything that interest me. You can check out my [resume](../files/brendalau-resume.pdf).
