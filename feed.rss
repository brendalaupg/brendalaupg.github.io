My name is Brenda Lau, and I aspire to help make people's lives better. I have decided to pursue my postgraduate studies to discover the world of Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) and to use my knowledge for the good of humanity. Whether we like it or not, A.I. is a part of our lives, and it is here to stay. Its steady growth is about to make waves of impact that will change every industry in the next decade - and I want to be a part of it.</p><p>Working as a Software Engineer, I get the chance to build with technology to impact the communities around me. After working in the technology industry for three years, I seek to broaden my skillset from software development to Artificial Intelligence. I believe the Master in Applied Computing programme offered by Taylor's University will open up career opportunities for me as a Machine Learning Engineer. I want to go down this journey in search of knowledge and skills of what A.I. can do for humanity and to push the boundaries of what is possible.</p><h2>Interest in Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>My first experience with A.I. was with Machine Learning when I had used it to enter Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) Scholarship in 2018. It is a yearly competition for students worldwide, challenged to create an interactive experience through code using their technology. As I was looking around for ideas, I came across Apple's latest framework called CoreML. It is a framework that integrates machine learning models in apps. Wanting to stand out and making it personable, I wanted to make an app that teaches people how to fold an origami crane - a favourite hobby of mine.</p><p>There was no viable image dataset that I could find online, so I had opted to create my own. I took hundreds of photos of origami cranes steps to create my dataset for my machine learning model. Alongside CoreML, I used another framework called Vision for its object classification to identify each step of the user's folding experience. My hard work paid off as I had won that year, amongst 350 other students.</p><p>Winning that competition got me an exclusive ticket to attend their developer conference that year. I got to attend the announcement of Apple's latest technologies and further developed my interest in Machine Learning. At the conference I met other scholarship winners, and it was interesting to see their take on Machine Learning. I met the engineers who build the frameworks I used, which got me my scholarship and gave advice on how I can further improve it. It was an eye-opening experience.</p><p>Since then, I have been intrigued by A.I. - motivating me to study and tinker around with neural networks, machine learning and computer vision in my spare time. As enjoyable as it is during my self-learning, I felt that I had only scratched the surface. I realize what I wanted was to pursue this interest as a career option. After some consideration, I thought that it was time for me to take this interest and pursue it formally with this Master's programme.</p><h2>Pursuing postgraduates studies</h2><p>When I first thought about it, I had wondered if I could learn the same thing online. The answer to that is yes, as learning resources about A.I. and Machine Learning are readily available online. However, it is not an easy feat to accomplish alone. There are many opportunities that a Master's degree can open up for me. I believe that this programme designed by Taylor's will provide the expertise to give me a competitive edge in this fast-growing industry.</p><p>Besides credentials, one may think a Master's degree is nothing but a piece of paper. I believe that it can be something more, as it is what you do during your studies that makes all the difference. I want my postgraduate experience to be memorable and productive. As I embark on uncharted territory, I believe that it is essential to meet like-minded individuals pursuing the same field. In my opinion, the friends and connections you make along the way is external accountability that will help me stay the course of my academic journey. Working with others is another essential aspect of learning, as people can achieve great things and accomplish more together. It will also open up future opportunities for collaboration after graduation in the future.</p><p>Only by standing on the shoulders of giants can we continue to make progress and challenge our understanding. This is why I believe academic experts at Taylor's can provide expertise and constructive criticism during my studies.</p><p>Besides that, I want to work on projects with more intent. During my undergraduate studies, I only had worked on projects as per the assignment requirements. I would only do the bare minimum to maintain a high grade to achieve my first class honours degree. While I still believe that I had worked hard for my Bachelor's, I want to pursue my Master's degree with a different intention. I want to work on projects that will both help me deepen my understand and have the potential to have a real-world impact. With these intentions, I believe that these projects will help me showcase my knowledge and skills to my future employers to prove that I am a capable engineer.</p><p>While the future is uncertain, I wish to work in industries to solve real-world issues using A.I. and help prepare these industries for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I eventually want to lead a team of professionals to innovate and implement cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems. This is my way of contributing back to society.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In conclusion, my interest in A.I. started as a small project that evolved into an interest while working as a Software Engineer. I wish to pursue this interest formally for my upcoming Master's programme. I believe that it will give me a competitive edge and create career opportunities for me. I want to meet others pursuing the same field and put my knowledge to the test by academic and industrial experts. But moreover, this is something that I truly want for myself to grow in my professional career and as well in my self-learning journey. With that, I look forward to my academic journey at Taylor's University.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">brendalaupg.com/life/01-forward</guid><title>Forward</title><description>Looking forward to 2021.</description><link>brendalaupg.com/life/01-forward</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0800</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Forward</h1><p>The past few years have felt like a roller coaster. I felt the rush after reaching my highest point, descending downward until I crash and burn. I’ve struggled to get back up on my feet so many times, but I always ended up in the same place. In that place was where I threw away the mindset that drove me here. But it’s the same place where I found the courage to forgive myself. I felt that this was what I needed. For the first time in a long time, I have a fresh start. No expectations; with only one question in my mind, “Where do you want to go?”</p><p>It’s easy to look at what others have and believe you want the same things. I’ve felt this way for a long time - thinking “If I did this, then I’ll be happy” or “If I got that job, then I’ll be successful as them.” But at some point, I realized that I don’t want to be living someone else’s life or chasing someone else’s dream - I want to be living in mine.</p><p>I did a lot of self-reflection, wondering what I really wanted to do. I spent days researching my options, and I decided to pursue my Master’s degree to specialize in Artificial Intelligence. There were many sleepless nights, wondering if I’m making the wrong decision. But I found clarity within myself after re-reading my intentions for this year and explaining it to my closes friends of this decision.</p><p>My journey ahead is as scary and uncertain as ever - but I want to take this leap of faith and seize this opportunity - knowing that this is what I want for myself. When I feel like giving up, I want to come back to this post and remind myself why.</p><p>It’s a little late, but happy twenty-twenty one! I’m looking forward to what comes my way :)</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
