I felt the rush after reaching my highest point, descending downward until I crash and burn. I’ve struggled to get back up on my feet so many times, but I always ended up in the same place. In that place was where I threw away the mindset that drove me here. But it’s the same place where I found the courage to forgive myself. I felt that this was what I needed. For the first time in a long time, I have a fresh start. No expectations; with only one question in my mind, “Where do you want to go?”</p><p>It’s easy to look at what others have and believe you want the same things. I’ve felt this way for a long time - thinking “If I did this, then I’ll be happy” or “If I got that job, then I’ll be successful as them.” But at some point, I realized that I don’t want to be living someone else’s life or chasing someone else’s dream - I want to be living in mine.</p><p>I did a lot of self-reflection, wondering what I really wanted to do. I spent days researching my options, and I decided to pursue my Master’s degree to specialize in Artificial Intelligence. There were many sleepless nights, wondering if I’m making the wrong decision. But I found clarity within myself after re-reading my intentions for this year and explaining it to my closes friends of this decision.</p><p>My journey ahead is as scary and uncertain as ever - but I want to take this leap of faith and seize this opportunity - knowing that this is what I want for myself. When I feel like giving up, I want to come back to this post and remind myself why.</p><p>It’s a little late, but happy twenty-twenty one! I’m looking forward to what comes my way :)</p></div><span>Tags: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/personal">personal</a></li></ul></article></div><footer><p><div>2021 © Brenda Lau</div>Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
